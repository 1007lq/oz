.SH NAME
oz-examples - example TDL files for Oz.

.SH DESCRIPTION
The
.I oz-install(1)
,
.I oz-customize(1)
, and
.I oz-generate-icicle(1)
man pages explain the command-line usage of the Oz commands.  One of
the required input parameters to all of the above commands is a TDL
(Template Description Language) file, which describes the OS the user
wants to install, where to get the media from, and any additional
packages or actions the user wants to take on the operating system.
This man page describes a number of TDL examples and what happens when
they are used.  Since the TDL is XML, standard XPath notation is used
to describe various elements of the XML.
