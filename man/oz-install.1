.TH OZ-INSTALL 1 "Dec 2010" "oz-install"

.SH NAME
oz-install - tool to automatically install operating systems into files

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B oz-install [OPTIONS] <tdl-file>

.SH DESCRIPTION
This is a tool to automatically install operating system into files
that represent disk images.  The input is an XML file representing the
operating system and packages to be installed.  By default (and by
design), the first stage of the install only installs a JEOS (Just
Enough Operating System); customization, including the installation of
additional packages can also be done, but requires additional flags.

Note that oz-install does the actual installation using a combination
of KVM and libvirt, so both of these must be available (and working)
for oz-install to have a chance to succeed.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B "\-a <auto>"
Use the user-provided auto installation file \fBauto\fR.  By default, Oz
will use a hard-coded auto-installation file (kickstart, preseed, sif,
etc) to do a basic OS installation.  Using this option, the user can
provide an alternate auto-installation file to do the install.  The
caveat is that user-provided auto-installation files are more likely
to cause installation errors, so this option should be used with caution.
.TP
.B "\-c <config>"
Get the configuration from config file \fBconfig\fR, instead of the
default /etc/oz/oz.cfg.  If neither one exists, Oz will use sensible
defaults.  The config file is in standard ini format; for an
explanation of the sections and keys, see the
.B CONFIGURATION FILE
section.
.TP
.B "\-d <loglevel>"
Turn on debugging output to level \fBloglevel\fR.  The log levels are:
.RS 7
.IP "0 - errors only (this is the default)"
.IP "1 - errors and warnings"
.IP "2 - errors, warnings, and information"
.IP "3 - all messages"
.IP "4 - all messages, prepended with the level and classname"
.RE
.TP
.B "\-f"
Force the download of the install media.  By default, oz-install will
always try to use a locally cached version of the install media if it
is available.  You can use this flag to force it to always download
the install media, even if it has a local version available.
.TP
.B "\-g"
Generate the ICICLE (a package manifest, with some additional metadata)
after the installation is complete.
.TP
.B "\-h"
Print a short help message.
.TP
.B "\-p"
Cleanup old guests before installation.  By default, if a guest with
the same libvirt UUID, libvirt name, or diskimage exists prior to Oz
starting installation, Oz will abort.  If this option is used, then Oz
will undefine the libvirt guest with the same name or UUID and delete
the diskimage, so it should be used with caution.
.TP
.B "\-u"
Customize the image after installation.  This generally installs
additional packages onto the disk image after installation.

.SH CONFIGURATION FILE
The Oz configuration file is in standard INI format with several
sections.  If any section or configuration key is missing, Oz will use
a sensible default.  For true/false configuration keys, the values of
"true", "True", "yes", or "Yes" can be used to turn the option on, and
"false", "False", "no", or "No" can be used to turn the behavior off.
The configuration file should have the following form:

.sp
.in +4n
.nf
[paths]
output_dir = /var/lib/libvirt/images
data_dir = /var/lib/oz

[libvirt]
uri = qemu:///system
type = kvm

[cache]
original_media = yes
.fi
.in

The \fBpaths\fR section defines the paths that Oz will use for storing data.
The \fBoutput_dir\fR key describes where to store the images after they are
built, and the \fBdata_dir\fR key describes where to cache install media and
use temporary storage.  Both locations have to have a decent amount of
free disk space in order for Oz to work properly.

The \fBlibvirt\fR section allows some manipulation of how Oz uses libvirt.
The \fBuri\fR key describes the libvirt URI to use to do the guest
installation, and the \fBtype\fR key defines what type of virtualization to use.

The \fBcache\fR section allows some manipulation of how Oz caches
data.  The caching of data in Oz is a tradeoff between installation
time and storage space.  The \fBoriginal_media\fR key tells Oz
to cache the original installation media so that it does not have to
download it the next time an install for the same operating system is
requested.
