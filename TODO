1.  More OS support:
     - Ubuntu 5.04, 5.10, 6.06, 10.04, and 10.10
     - Debian Etch, Lenny, Squeeze
     - RHEL-6
     - openSUSE 11.0, 11.1, 11.2 (autoyast)
     - OpenBSD (http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~brendan/howtos/openbsd_install/)
     - NetBSD (anita)
     - FreeBSD
     - Dragonfly BSD
     - Windows Vista, 2008, 7, 98, 95, ME
     - RHL 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2 (only nfs installs work)
2.  Add partition/disk size support to the IDL.
3.  Add improved error logging to guest installation.  That is, if the guest
installation fails, we want to get detailed error information out of the
installer to find out why.  Fedora/RHEL support doing remote syslog via
network or virtio-serial, and I also believe anaconda will dump data to syslog
during installation, so that is one avenue to pursue.
4.  Instead of calling out to an external 'gvnccapture' command to collect
a screenshot, we should instead write the thing in python using the gtk-vnc
library.  Unfortunately I have not figured out how to do it in python yet,
so this needs further research.
5.  If two of the same OSes are being installed at the same time on the same
machine, they will trample all over each other.  We need to handle this
situation.
6.  We should have our own exception class, rather than just raising "Exception"
all of the time.
7.  It should be possible to replace the subprocess call to fuseiso by
implementing our own fuse-python subclass.  Though this is probably a bit of
work.  Or we could possibly use libguestfs; it is unclear.
8.  Before attempting an install, check the data_dir and output_dir to make
sure that they will approximately have enough space for the install media
and the output disk image, respectively.
